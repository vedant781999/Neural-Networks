# Neural-Networks
Neural Networks for House Price dataset is trained and experimented with different hidden layers(2, 3 layers) and different weight initializations like Gaussian, Uniform etc. Also, different epochs , learning rate,neurons and activation functions in different layers were also experimented with. 

The accuracy and other evaluation parameters like F-score, precision and recall were recorded for all those experiments . 

The best accuracy obtained was around ~87%, with Gaussian weight initialization for both type of hidden layers.

For the output layer, softmax activation function was used for binary classification . The best accuracy was obtained when sigmoid was used 
as an activation function for the hidden layer with Gaussian Weight Initialization.
